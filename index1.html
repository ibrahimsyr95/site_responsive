        <h3  > Violette</h3>
                  <p  >     Violette protection software gives security solutions to manage devices that have access to a                       company’s or person’s private network. These software tools protect against a number of security threats and           try to normalize security measures across many devices.
                    </p>
                 <p >
                        IT system administrators are given a central console that allows them to view Violette connecting to a specific network. Administrators are provided with a number of security mechanisms to protect against attacks, hacks, among other threats. These applications provide a variety of safeguarding tools such as antivirus, firewalls, and virtual private networks.
                  </p>
                      <p  >
                          Violette security tools provide a simplified, centralized interface to monitor and deploy devices connected to a network. From the main management console, administrators can view nearly all of their network’s infrastructure, depending on the product. They are also able to view activity, create reports, and run system scans to continuously protect against any and all threats that may arise.
                    </p>
